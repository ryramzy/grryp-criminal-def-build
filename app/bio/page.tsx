        <p className="mb-6">
          I'm Matt, a dedicated builder, strategist, and advocate for accessible information and inclusive technology. My career has spanned investigative journalism, public policy, and tech innovation, all shaped by a deep-rooted passion for making the world more navigable—both literally and systemically.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          I co-founded Vngle, a platform that decentralizes news gathering to combat misinformation and amplify underrepresented voices. My work has taken me across industries, from covering climate crises and human rights issues to researching democratization and leading operational strategy for a think tank partnership in New York. With a background in political science and international affairs from Morehouse College, I thrive at the crossroads of governance, media, and emerging technologies.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Living with Stargardt's Disease, I've also become a vocal advocate for accessibility, ensuring technology and media work for everyone. Beyond my professional work, I'm always exploring—whether it's new cultures, languages, or ways to solve complex challenges. If any of this resonates with you, let's connect and push boundaries together.
